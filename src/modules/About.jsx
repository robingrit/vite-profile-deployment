            I am a Java Developer student who has also learned some Javascript.
            Before pursuing a career in programming, I worked as a chef and
            gained valuable experience in the industry. Currently, I am located
            in Malm√∂, Sweden.

            In addition to my programming skills, I have also gained experience
            with SEO and marketing. As a person, I am hard-working, determined,
            and able to handle stress well. I am always open to trying new
            things and seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and
            grow

          <p id="about_text">
            For me, working with a team that I trust and enjoy working with is
            more important than the work itself. I value collaboration and
            believe that it is crucial for achieving success in any project.
